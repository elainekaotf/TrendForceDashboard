#!/bin/bash
# Scheduler entry point for TrendForceDash. Runs a named job (a group of
# FR scripts in dependency order) and reports failures without stopping
# the rest of the job. See scheduling.md for how this is actually
# scheduled (launchd, not cron) and SRS Section 6 (Scheduling
# Requirements) for the source frequencies.
#
# Usage: bash run_pipeline.sh <scan|core|accounts|daily>
#
# Jobs:
#   scan     (every 4h)   FR-02 (scan tier only) -> FR-04
#            Implements the SRS's own proposed resolution to Open Issue #1
#            ("detect every 4 hours" vs "run every 6 hours"): a two-tier
#            schedule. This tier is FR-02-01 only (top rising topics, no
#            KOL/sub-topic drill-down) for the 4h range - fast enough to
#            run every 4h without duplicating 'core's full 6h recompute.
#   core     (every 6h)  FR-01 -> FR-02 (full) -> FR-03 -> FR-04
#            Topic clustering feeds FR-02/03/06; FR-04 refreshes right
#            after so newly-produced topic/sentiment/KOL calls are
#            queued for review promptly. FR-02 here is the full
#            FR-02-01..04 chain across all 5 ranges - the other tier of
#            the two-tier schedule above.
#   accounts (every 8h)  FR-05
#            Independent of the core chain - only touches account
#            status + own-account reply drafts.
#   daily    (once/day)  FR-06 -> FR-04
#            generate_summaries.py runs FR-03 itself in 'daily' mode
#            internally, so this doesn't need to call nlp_sentiment.py
#            separately. FR-04 refreshes again to queue the day's
#            summaries for review.
#
# Every job starts with sync_data.sh (pulls fresh CSVs from the sibling
# scraper repos - see that script's header for why this is needed at all),
# regenerates docs/index.html (generate_dashboard.py), then publishes it
# (publish.sh: commit, push, confirm the GitHub Pages deploy) so the live
# site reflects whatever that job just produced - previously this only
# updated the local file, so scheduled runs left the public URL stale
# until someone happened to push manually.
#
# FR-07 (self-service upload) is user-triggered, not scheduled - it isn't
# part of any job here.

# Locking: scan/core/accounts/daily all regenerate the SAME docs/index.html
# and do their own git commit+push (publish.sh) at the end - with no lock,
# overlapping invocations (multiple scheduled launchd jobs, plus the
# scraper-triggered chains added 2026-07-14/15) raced each other's pushes.
# In practice this showed up as GitHub Pages deployments getting cancelled
# (superseded by the next push landing seconds later) and a growing
# backlog where "pipeline run complete" timestamps were hours after
# "Starting" - not because the actual work was slow, but because the run
# was queued behind other overlapping invocations the whole time. mkdir is
# atomic on POSIX filesystems, so use a lock directory as a mutex - same
# pattern as sync_data.sh's own lock, just with a much longer stale
# timeout since a legitimate run here can genuinely take an hour or more
# (sync_data.sh's own steps are short by comparison).

STALE_AFTER=7200  # 2h - generously above any observed legitimate run time
# Staleness must be judged by the lock DIRECTORY's own age (its mtime from
# when mkdir created it), not by how long THIS waiter has been polling -
# observed 2026-07-17: a waiter queued behind several back-to-back
# legitimate holders accumulated over 7200s of ITS OWN wait time and then
# stole the lock from a still-actively-running job (mid-scan, not crashed),
# defeating the mutex for ~2 minutes. A per-waiter counter conflates "how
# long have I waited" with "how long has the current holder had it" -
# under sustained backlog those are completely different numbers.
