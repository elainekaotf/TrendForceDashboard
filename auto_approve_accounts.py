"""
Zero-touch version of FR-05's "request tracking" approval step.

add_account.py/remove_account.py were originally written as a deliberate
manual gate - a human reads the GitHub issue and decides whether to run
the command. This script removes that gate on purpose (explicitly asked
for): it polls open `add-account`/`remove-account`-labeled issues on
elainekaotf/TrendForceDashboard, parses the platform/handle out of each
title ("Add account: <platform>/<handle>" / "Remove account: ..." - the
exact format generate_dashboard.py's request form generates), and runs
add_account.py/remove_account.py for every one it can, closing the issue
with a comment either way.

Only X and Facebook are actually actionable (add_account.py/
remove_account.py don't support LinkedIn yet) - a LinkedIn request, or a
title that doesn't parse, gets a comment explaining why and is left open
rather than silently dropped.

Requires `gh` authenticated (`gh auth login`) with access to
elainekaotf/TrendForceDashboard.

Usage: python3 auto_approve_accounts.py
