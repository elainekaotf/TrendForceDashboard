"""
FR-05 Account & Comment Management.

Compliance note (SRS Open Issue #2 - still TBC): platforms prohibit
inauthentic accounts and unauthorized automated interaction. This script
therefore only ever DRAFTS replies for our own official accounts
(TrendForce on X, TrendForce.tw on Facebook) and never sends anything -
a human must mark a draft 'approved' and, after posting it themselves
through the official account, mark it 'sent'. It never manages or
auto-replies through competitor or third-party accounts; those are
monitoring-only, matching FR-01/02/03's scope.

Processing:
  - Account status: platform, follower count (from follower_cache.json,
    where available), last-post recency, computed status (active/stale/
    inactive) for every account load_posts() tracks (own + competitors).
  - Comment aggregation: for OUR OWN posts only, flag ones with a reply
    count at or above NEEDS_RESPONSE_THRESHOLD as needing a response.
  - Reply-draft suggestions: informed by that post's FR-01 topic and FR-03
    sentiment. When scrape_own_comments.js has actually found comments for
    a post (own_comments.json is nonempty for that URL), select_top_comments()
    picks the top (most-liked) comments still within RECENT_WITHIN_DAYS and
    craft_comment_reply() addresses the top one by name, quoting what they
    said - a real response, not a generic one. A post with zero scraped
    comments (not scraped yet, or genuinely none) falls back to the
    original generic topic-based draft_reply. Queued for human approval in
    analysis/reply_queue.json.
  - Response tracking: status lifecycle drafted -> approved -> sent, or
    dismissed, persisted across runs like FR-04's review queue.

Output: analysis/account_status.json, analysis/reply_queue.json

CLI:
  python3 account_comment_management.py build
  python3 account_comment_management.py list [--status drafted]
  python3 account_comment_management.py show <id>
  python3 account_comment_management.py approve <id> --reviewer <name>
